I didn't find any lower bounds.

Recent upper bounds could be probably obtained from:

* Benavides, A. J., & Ritt, M. (2016). Two simple and effective heuristics for minimizing the makespan in non-permutation flow shops. Computers & Operations Research, 66, 160–169. doi:10.1016/j.cor.2015.08.001
* Benavides, A. J., & Ritt, M. (2018). Fast heuristics for minimizing the makespan in non-permutation flow shops. Computers & Operations Research, 100, 230–243. doi:10.1016/j.cor.2018.07.017

Both accessible via sci-hub
