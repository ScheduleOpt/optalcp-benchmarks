# Job Shop Scheduling Problem

The job shop scheduling problem consists of *n* jobs and *m* machines. Each job
is a sequence of operations that must be executed in a given order. Each
operation requires a specific machine for a given duration. Each machine can
process only one operation at a time. The goal is to minimize the makespan, i.e.,
the time when all jobs are completed.
