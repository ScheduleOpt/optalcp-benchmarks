# Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows

## Credits

The initial version of this benchmark was written by VÃ­t Knobloch.

## Data files

Data files were downloaded from [CVRPLIB](http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/).

Some data files are too big. The transition matrix does not fit into Node.js memory, and Node.js crashes with an out-of-memory error.

## Known solutions

Knows solutions (also from [CVRPLIB](http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/)) can be found in the directory [`known-solutions`](known-solutions).

## Benchmark-specific options

```text
  --objective <makespan|path> Objective function
  --scale <number>            Scale the time by a constant factor
  --rounding <round|ceil>     How to round 2D distances
  --breakVehicleSymmetry      Order vehicles by the maximum city visited
```

See below for more details.

## About the model

The model is similar to the model for [Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem](../cvrp). There are a few differences:

* Nodes have service times bigger than 0. Because of that, there are no issues with the triangular inequality as in the [CVRP benchmark](../cvrp).
* Nodes have ready and due times, which are reflected by the minimum and maximum start times of the visits. The due date is not the maximum end time because sometimes `ready + service` is bigger than `due`.

## Rounding

The nodes are given by 2D coordinates, their distances are computed by the Euclidean distance. As OptalCP requires integer distances, the distances are rounded. The parameter `--rounding` can be set to `round` or `ceil`. The default is `round`.

## Scaling

Some known solutions give a non-integer path length, but OptalCP works only with integers. To get higher precision, all the input values can be multiplied by a constant factor given by `--scale <number>`. The objective value is increased by the scaling factor, too.

## Makespan objective

The default objective is to minimize the total length of the routes. However, there is also an option `--objective makespan` to minimize the length of the longest route. In this case, we compute when the last vehicle returns to the depot.

Note that the makespan objective includes service times. In contrast, the default objective "path" deduces the service times from the total durations of the routes.

## Symmetry breaking

Vehicle symmetry can be broken by the parameter `--breakVehicleSymmetry` in the same way as in the [CVRP benchmark](../cvrp). Unlike CVRP, there is no direction symmetry in this benchmark.

As usual, symmetry breaking may be helpful for optimality proofs and the FDS search. However, it may slow down the LNS search.
