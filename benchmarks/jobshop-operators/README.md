# Jobshop with Operators

It is a regular Jobshop with additional requirements that every operation needs (besides a machine) one of the operators during its processing. All operators are the same, and the number of operators is limited. The benchmark accepts the additional command-line argument `--nbOperators`.

## Instances

Uses the same instances as regular [Jobshop](../jobshop/README.md).
