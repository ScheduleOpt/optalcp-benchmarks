# Job Shop with Operators

A variant of the job shop problem where each operation requires both a machine
and an operator. All operators are identical and interchangeable, but their
number is limited, adding a cumulative resource constraint to the problem.

The benchmark accepts the command-line argument `--nbOperators <number>` to
specify the number of available operators.

## Instances

Uses the same instances as regular [Job Shop](../jobshop/README.md).
