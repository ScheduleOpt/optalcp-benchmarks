# Traveling Salesman Problem

# Instances

Taken from [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/).
The format is described in paper [TSPLIB 95](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/tsp95.pdf).

# Implementation

The format is rather complex. Only 2D and geographical dinstances are implemented.
I suspect that other types of distances may not respect triangular inequality.

Note that OptalCP does not focus on pure TSP, there are better tools around.
Still, TSP can be modelled.
