# Traveling Salesman Problem

## Credits

VÃ­t Knobloch made significant corrections and improvements to the benchmark.
He is also the author of _triangular correction_ described below.

## Instances

Taken from [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/).
The format is described in the paper [TSPLIB 95](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/tsp95.pdf).

## Implementation

The format is rather complex. Only 2D distances (`EUC_2D`, `CEIL_2D`) and geographical distances (`GEO`) are implemented. The computation of `GEO` distances may be incorrect because some known optimal solutions do not match.

## Triangular correction

The distance matrix may not fulfill triangular inequality. It can happen even in
2D case due to rounding errors. For example, let's consider 3 points with the following distances:

```text
|AB| = 5.4  rounded to 5
|BC| = 5.4  rounded to 5
|AC| = 10.6 rounded to 11
```

After the rounding, the triangular inequality is violated. Increasing the precision (by multiplying all distances by a constant) helps, but it doesn't eliminate the problem.

OptalCP applies the distance matrix not only to direct successors on the path. In the example above, the path `A -> B -> C` cannot be shorter than 11 for OptalCP. Therefore, OptalCP may ignore some solutions and claim optimality even if the solution is not optimal (considering only direct successors).

Benchmark instances with triangular inequality are needed to make a fair comparison. Triangular correction shortens some of the distances to fulfill the inequality. It is time-consuming to compute corrections. Therefore, the correction is precompiled and stored in `data/*.corr` files. To apply the correction, use the command line parameter `--triangularCorrection`.

Note that triangular correction changes the instance. Therefore, the results are not directly comparable with those of the original instances.

## Direction symmetry

The problem is symmetric concerning the order of the cities. I.e., the order of the towns in the solution can be reversed without changing the cost. By default, the provided model does not break this symmetry. To break it, use command line parameter `--breakDirectionSymmetry`.

Breaking the symmetry can be helpful for optimality proofs with `searchType=FDS`. However, it may slow down the LNS search.
